# Percolation-Simulation
**JavaFX GUI simulation of a percolation simulation - water passing through a filter.**  
The implementation behind this was originally used for monte carlo simulations.  
Its purpose was to determine the density of a solid that would allow for percolation based on varying fluid types.  
This GUI allows you to run and visualize a single custom simulation as well as manually edit the tiles on the grid.
